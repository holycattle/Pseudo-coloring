Test cases are in the form
	from until r_val g_val b_val
where from, until, r_val, g_val, and b_val are integers from 0 to 255

Bugs:
	1. For some reason, the program returns a segmentation fault when r_val and g_val are equal to 100
	2. Cannot accommodate more than one test case in a file for some reason

Usage:
	./main test_case_input image_input
